Simple Shell
In this repository, we are aiming to build a simple UNIX command line interpreter.
Our simple shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command.
It can handle simple comands as well as commands with arguments.
It can handle the path as well as implement exit and env, which are built-in.
